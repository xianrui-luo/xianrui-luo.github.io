title: "Defocus to Focus: Photo-realistic Bokeh Rendering by Fusing Defocus and Radiance Priors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/information
excerpt: 'We consider the problem of realistic bokeh rendering from a single all-in-focus image. Bokeh rendering mimics aesthetic shallow depth-of-field (DoF) in professional photography, but these visual effects generated by existing methods suffer from simple flat background blur and blurred in-focus regions, giving rise to unrealistic rendered results. In this work, we argue that realistic bokeh rendering should (i) model depth relations and distinguish in-focus regions, (ii) sustain sharp in-focus regions, and (iii) render physically accurate Circle of Confusion (CoC). To this end, we present a Defocus to Focus (D2F) framework to learn realistic bokeh rendering by fusing defocus priors with the all-in-focus image and by implementing radiance priors in layered fusion. Since no depth map is provided, we introduce defocus hallucination to integrate depth by learning to focus. The predicted defocus map implies the blur amount of bokeh and is used to guide weighted layered rendering. In layered rendering, we fuse images blurred by different kernels based on the defocus map. To increase the reality of the bokeh, we adopt radiance virtualization to simulate scene radiance. The scene radiance used in weighted layered rendering reassigns weights in the soft disk kernel to produce the CoC. To ensure the sharpness of in-focus regions, we propose to fuse upsampled bokeh images and original images. We predict the initial fusion mask from our defocus map and refine the mask with a deep network. We evaluate our model on a large-scale bokeh dataset. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of rendering visually pleasing bokeh effects in complex scenes. In particular, our solution receives the runner-up award in the AIM 2020 Rendering Realistic Bokeh Challenge.'
